title: "Something about today"
---

There was something about today. Not too loud, not too quiet. Wasn't too awake and wasn't too tired. Neither hot nor cold. I was not happy and I was not sad. I was just in the middle. I was here. Right here. Existing. I am not sure why I felt this way. Time just kept on tick, tick, ticking away. Here I am, sharing my thoughts, excited to see what the world has brought. Right now, I have no problems relative to what others experience. I am practicing discipline, healthier habits. I found out some news in the past couple of days and I'm hoping I can be there to help them.

Well, heres to seeing you tomorrow.
