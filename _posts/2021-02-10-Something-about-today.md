title: "Something about today"
---

There was something about today. Not too loud, not too quiet. Wasn't too awake and wasn't too tired. Neither hot nor cold. I was not happy and I was not sad. I was just in the middle. I was here. Right here. Existing. I am not sure why I felt this way. Time just kept on tick, tick, ticking away. Here I am, sharing my thoughts, excited to see what the world has brought. Right now, I have no problems relative to what others experience.

I am practicing discipline, healthier habits (reading, exercise, coding, building my favorite projects(Which I will post here)). I found out some news in the past couple of days and I'm hoping I can be there to help them. With time I'm sure I'll have more things to talk about. I'll be more articulate and be able to write out my thoughts more thoroughly. Right now it's just word vomit. But here's to establishing a more consistent schedule.

Well, heres to seeing you tomorrow.
