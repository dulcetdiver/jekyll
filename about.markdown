Hey, I'm Jeremy. I'm just a dude who is attempting to be self-sufficient in life. I have this youtube channel called ['The Whiteboard'](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbcicb3w4SC9d0Duk6kW8-w) where you might learn a thing or two. I also write about stuff.

Maybe, just maybe, one day in the future, this information will be absorbed by some curious person and to you I bid you a hello and a thank you. Thanks for finding my blog in an ocean of information. Thank you for taking the time to read what I have to say. Maybe one day we can discuss these things in person. I hope life treats you well and your curiosity takes you far. Well, relax, take it easy and enjoy my words.
